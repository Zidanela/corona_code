Project: NeonPong
Author: Caleb Place

NeonPong is a complete, finished remake of Pong. It is very simple to learn to play, even simpler to understand the (heavily) commented code, yet actually quite fun.


You move your paddle around (touch/click inside of the faint yellowish box) and hit the ball when it comes to you. That's it.


It has four different levels - Easy, Medium, Hard, and Endless:

In the Easy level, you have a long paddle, the ball goes slowly, and the CPU is extremely slow.

In the Medium level, you are shorter, the ball goes faster, and the CPU is less slow.

In the Hard level, the ball goes quite fast, the CPU is quite smart, and you are quite small.

And, finally, in the Endless level, it's somewhere between the Medium level and the Hard level and there is (basically) no point limit.


Each time the ball hits the CPU's paddle, it gains a little bit of speed. You can beat the CPU before the ball gets too fast by "slamming" the ball - slide your paddle down quickly while hitting it. If the velocity goes above a certain amount, you'll get a "Nice Shot!" notice with the ball's velocity underneath it.


NeonPong does not use physics at all - instead it uses an extremely simplified version of the ParticlePhysics that I wrote for CBEffects (I edited it to only add a single physics object, no damping, angularVelocity, etc). Each time it hits a paddle, it's X velocity reverses. That's it.


All the graphics were created by me and Sketch - you can use them, change them, etc. :)

I'd like to thank Danny for the SceneManager resource.

Anything else, I made.

Enjoy!
