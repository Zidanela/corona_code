A class for retrieving information about the current device.

This is a mixture of many techniques I've seen over time, along with some of my own.

Also provides some various utility functions

1. Print out the information gathered to the console
2. Draw tics on the screen to show detected bounds
3. Verbose and non-verbose garbage collection agent
