Sprite Pack 1 - (C) 2005 Tymar Games - www.tymargames.co.uk
-----------------------------------------------------------

This pack contains several .png graphics of vehicles and accessories. The various components can be combined in a number of ways to produce different vehicles.

A couple of examples are included for you.

All of the images are 256x256 PNGs with transparency. Because of this, you may need to pad out or offset some of the images so that they all line up correctly when you combine them.

Conditions of use
-----------------
These graphcis have been made available for free. You can use them in your own projects, all I ask is a mention in the credits.

You must not sell these files on their own (or as part of a package of other similar files).

You may redistribute them providing that all files (including this readme) remain unaltered and intact.
