===================

Various bits and pieces, written either as components of a game or out of mere curiosity.

To run them, select from the listbox in the upper left corner and then hit "Launch".

**N.B.** The listbox mysteriously becomes empty if you do... something. Any insight on this is appreciated.

Most of the demos right now are just automatic. In "Nodes", you can drag the boxes themselves, drag lines
between the nodes, and break links between nodes. In "Timers", some of the output goes to the console, and
what's happening is probably not obvious without actually reading the code itself to see the flow.

"Game" is some bits from a game in progress. The "player" is the white dot, and can be controlled with the
buttons at the bottom or by double-tapping a spot on the map. A button also appears when you're over a warp
or switch, in order to use that. Currently, I only added a maze to be operated on by the switch.

Also, you can set some debug stuff in the Options screen, from the main menu, as well as wipe any persisent
state (in this case, any levels you've saved in the editor).

"Editor" is likewise part of an editor for the same game. There is a lot going on, and I haven't documented
much. Maybe later I'll describe how to use it. :P If by some chance you puzzle it out, you can hit "Test" to
try the level out (at a minimum, you must assign a starting cell in the "General" view). An erroneous level
will be reported before you launch, via the the console / message box (well, that's the idea, anyway...).
